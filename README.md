This project is a C++ reimplementation of Motif Locator. Please see documentation for more details.

Molotov is an implementation of the algorithm sketched out in Gert Thijs' PhD thesis, Probabilistic Methods to Search for Regulatory Elements in Sets of Coregulated Genes (Thijs 2003).

Its sole purpose is to linearly scan an input genomic sequence searching for motifs with a high probabilistic signal relative to an input consensus matrix. In this sense, the algorithm is similar to a synonym matcher for any given data set, with the bonus of providing location-based information and a score proportional to the amount of signal provided by each candidate match.

For further algorithmic considerations, please consult the paper.
