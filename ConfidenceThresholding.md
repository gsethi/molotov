## Generating a p-value for confidence thresholding ##

For generating a distribution of values suitable for p-value calculations of the aggregate score, it is recommended that a suitable representative sample be generated by running the tool along the given input sequence without filtering enabled. It is expected that this distribution will be extremely tight, tending towards zero, skewing significant values off to the right.

Once this distribution is generated, the p-value may be trivially computed for each value of output. As care and some degree of manual selection should be undertaken with statistical analysis of the output data, we do not define these computations as part of the tool, allowing instead for downstream users and tools to define these computations using the output of Molotov.

A sample procedure might be, in pseudocode:
```
  cut (lines 0 through 1000) of our input sequence`
  for each motif:
     run (motiflocator unfiltered) across these lines for a given motif
     compute mu (mean), sigma (std dev), and e (error) for the given data
     using these calculations, compute the standard deviations from the mean. From here, convert to a significance p-value
```


This procedure should allow for p-value calculations suitable for further statistical analysis and, ultimately, publication. Stronger estimators of the distribution, such as [kernel density estimation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation), have also been considered and are currently in use.
